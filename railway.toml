# Railway deployment configuration
# Docs: https://docs.railway.app
#
# Deploy steps:
#   1. Go to https://railway.app → New Project → Deploy from GitHub
#   2. Select this repo
#   3. Railway auto-detects Python and uses this file
#   4. Add env vars in the Railway dashboard:
#        GROQ_API_KEY=<your key>
#        MAX_QUANTUM_RINGS=3
#        MAX_GRAPH_VIZ_NODES=600
#        MAX_GRAPH_VIZ_EDGES=1500
#        LLM_MAX_TURNS=6
#   5. Update frontend/src/apiClient.js BASE to your Railway URL
#
# Railway gives $5 free credit/month — enough for ~500 hours of this app.
# No sleep/cold-start on free tier (unlike Render).
